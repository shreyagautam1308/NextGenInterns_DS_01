# NextGenInterns_DS_01
I made a data science project as an intern in NextGenInterns. My task was of Data Science Task01 i.e., Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a
categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or
genders in a population. To see the code visit this repository.
